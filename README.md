# Continuous Deployment of Sock-Shop Microservice Application With Terraform and Jenkins.
This repository contains some terraform script to automate the creation of a virtual private cloud (vpc), Eks cluster, worker nodes, and jenkins server to create a 
Continuous Deployment pipeline to trigger the build process of the scripts and kubernetes manifest files to deploy a sock-shop application, votingapp, Into an EKS Cluster on AWS.

## This Repository contains
- [x] Backend module which creates an S3 bucket and dynamodb to initiate remote state and state-locking.
- [x] Eks_Network module which creates VPC, 3 Private subnet and three public subnet, nat gateway, internet gateway, and route tables.
- [x] Eks_Cluster module which creates the Eks cluster, and 3 worker-nodes
- [x] Jenkins_Server module which creates a vpc, internet gateway, public subnet, route table, security groups and a t3.medium ubuntu ec2 instance and a shell script to install java and jenkins.
- [x] Logs module to create vpc log_flows and log the information inside an s3 bucket.
- [x] Monitoring module to launch prometheus-grafana in a monitoring namespace inside a worker-node.
- [x] ingress module to create ingress rules to expose the backend services to the internet traffics.
- [x] nginx-controller module to create a stagnant loadblancer that routes internet traffic to various services within the worker-nodes in diffrent namespaces via the ingress.
- [x] sock-shop folder containing the sock-shop micro-service application manifest file.
- [x] voting-app folder containing the voting application manifest file.
- [x] infrastructure-jenkinsfile containing jenkins build script for aws inftrastructure.
- [x] jenkinsfile containing jenkins build script for application deployment, ingress and nginx-controller.

## Tools Used
- [x] Terraform :- To automate infrastructure on AWS.
- [x] Jenkins :- To create Continuous Deployment pipeline.
- [x] Kubernetes :- For Container Orchestration.
- [x] Prometheus and Grafana :- For Monitoring, Alerting, and Data visualization.
- [x] S3 Bucket :- For Logging Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)  Traffics.
